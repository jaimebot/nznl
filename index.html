 <BR>**Nóngzhánnánlí** (2022 – 2022) is the name of the residential compound in Beijing where I lived during the last year I lived in China. This series is an inventory of the life and things I left behind, one object at a time as I remember them, until, maybe, I don’t miss Beijing anymore. As a substack series, this exercise partially owes its form to Chelsea Hodson’s Inventory, but rather than a catalogue of items I own, this is a catalogue of things that I no longer own. Once, at a university’s anthropology museum, I learned about how while the museum may be in possession of certain objects they have acquired for their collections, the museum does not own the right to the stories of the objects. That, too, touched me. Thank you for being along for the ride.
